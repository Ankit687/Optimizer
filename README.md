# Optimizer
C++ solutions to optimization problems

## About
The goal is to build an Optimization library for C++ which can provide solutions for single variable and muli-variable optimization, constrained and unconstrained problems. The users should be able to select the algorithm to be used and also access any intermediate data which is obtained whilst running the algorithm. 

**This repository is also hosted as a part of the Hacktoberfest. Register yourself [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and submit 5 PRs to win a free T-shirt. This repository is for you to learn the github workflow, understand the community and get started with Open Source.**

## Understanding the Repository
- `src` contains all the code
- `Theory` contains all the algorithms we need to implement
- `Features` has information about current features as well as features required. **New Contributors head here!**

## Key concepts
If you are pursuing engineering/ will be pursuing engineering/ have already pursued engineering, then this should be very easy for you to grasp. Without going too much into the mathematics you can easily code up the algorithms if you wish. But as a rule of thumb familiarity with these concepts would be helpful : 
- Basic C++
- Basic Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Polynomials and Polynomial Systems
- Linear Programming
- Quadratic Programming

**DON'T BE INTIMIDATED! YOU DON'T HAVE TO STUDY ALL THIS!** Read on to get started ...

## How to Contribute
- Read this `README` completely.
- Checkout `Features` and `Issues`
- Choose one which interests you, if it's already an Issue then add a comment claiming it. Else create a new issue.
- Read the respective section from `Theory` to understand how to get the code right
- Add the code and submit the PR by following the github workflow which you can find [here](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-fork-and-clone-a-github-repository)
