## THE RULES

- Code must be fully commented. Let us make it easier for others to understand your work
- Follow [this](https://blog.github.com/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/) for submitting PRs
- Always keep the conversation precise and relevant in the comments
- Open new issues only if there aren't similar ones put up already
- Try working on new issues rather than an issue someone is already pursuing(Unless the thread has been inactive for a few hours)
- Different PRs for different issues please
- Different commits for different files

Will add more if necessary..
